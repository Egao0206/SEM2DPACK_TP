# SEM2DPACK_TP
SEM2DPACK is a SEM software for solving 2D seismic wave propagation and earthquake rupture dynamics. 
TP is considering Thermal pressurization(TP) and Dilatancy(Dil), which are broadly thought the main thermal-hydrolic effects of rupture paopagate during earthquake. 

This version has been added the new *.f90 file into SEM2DPACK/Code/SRC, which is bc_dynflt_tp.f90. The file are mainly written by weng and liang, and this main part of code was modified from MDSBI version 4.1.9 by Eric Dunham, https://pangea.stanford.edu/~edunham/codes/codes.html.
